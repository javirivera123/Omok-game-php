# Omok-game-php
This is a Web Service that communicates with a java client to play the game Omok
# Instructions on how to run
1.) Downlaod the omokClient.jar file.
2.) Open file.
3.) Direct server
4.) Play game
# Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to understand the concepts of web
scripting languages and have a hands-on experience with web scripting
by writing small web service code in PHP [1].
# Assignment Requirements
You are to write a lightweight web service in PHP for playing omok
games. Omok, meaning "five pieces", is a two-player strategy game
typically played with go pieces, black and white stones, on a go board
with 15x15 intersections (or places) [Wikipedia]. It can also be
played with a paper and pencils because stones, once placed, are not
allowed to be moved or removed from the board. The two players
alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection,
and the goal of the game is to place one's stones in a row of five
consecutive intersections vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The
winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones.

As a web service, your PHP code provides only a few APIs implementing
the logic, data or process for playing omok games, not a complete Web
application including a GUI. The web service APIs are predefined and
specified as URLs (see below). Key requirements for your web service
include:

R1: The web service shall work with a provided Java client available
    and downloadble from the course website (omokClient.jar).

R2: The web service shall support multiple clients concurrently, each
    client playing against the server (see R5 below). 

R3: A game board shall consist of 15*15 intersections (or places) on
    which black/white stones can be placed.

R4: An individual place of a board shall be identified by a pair (x,y)
    of 0-based column/row indices, e.g., (0,2) for the intersection
    of the first column and the third row.

R5: The web service shall provide at least two different move
    strategies for the computer, e.g., random and smart. The smart
    strategy shall be indeed "smart" to allow for a realistic
    play. Minimally, it should detect a winning/loosing row, i.e., a
    sequence of three stones with both ends open and four stones with
    at least one end open. Hint: Use the Strategy design patterns to
    support different computer move strategies.

R6: The web service shall determine the outcome: win, loss, or draw.

The web service APIs are implemented as a set of URLs as specified
below. All communications between the web service and a client shall
be done using the HTTP query string and the JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON), a lightweight data-interchange format (see www.json.org)
[3]. All inputs to the web service shall be obtained from HTTP query
strings, and all outputs to the client shall be written in
JSON. Following the REST principles, the web service shall be
stateless and provide the following URL:

1. http://<omok-home>/info (short for .../info/ or .../info/index.php),
   where <omok-home> is the address of your omok service typically
   consisting of a host name and a pathname.
   Provide game information, including the board size and available
   computer move strategies. Below is a sample JSON output.

   {"size": 15, "strategies": ["Smart", "Random"]}

2. http://<omok-home>/new?strategy=s
   Create a new game to play against the specified computer strategy.
   A normal response will be a JSON string like:

     {"response": true, "pid": "55ed3eb95f5a3"}
     
   where pid is a unique play identifier generated by the web service. 
   It will be used to play the newly created game (see 3 below).

   Upon an error, it shall be notified to the client by providing an
   an appropriate error response like:

     {"response": false, "reason": "Strategy not specified"}
     {"response": false, "reason": "Unknown strategy"}

3. http://<omok-home>/play?pid=p&move=x,y
   Make a move by placing a stone on the specified place (x,y) to play
   the specified game (p).

   A normal response will be a JSON string like:
     
     {"response": true,
      "ack_move": {
        "x": 4, 
        "y": 5, 
        "isWin": false,   // winning move?
	"isDraw": false,  // draw?
	"row": []},       // winning row if isWin is true
      "move": {
        "x": 4, 
        "y": 6, 
        "isWin": false, 
        "isDraw": false, 
        "row": []}}

   where the "ack_move" is the acknowledgement and outcome of the
   requested player move, and the "move" is the computer move made
   right after the player's; there will be no computer move if the
   player move is a game-ending (win or draw) move. For a winning
   move, the value of "row" is an array of numbers denoting the
   indices of the winning sequence [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn], e.g.,

     "row":[6,7,7,7,8,7,9,7,10,7]

   If there is an error, it should be reported to the client by
   providing an appropriate error message like:

     {"response": false, "reason": "Pid not specified"}
     {"response": false, "reason": "Unknown pid"}
     {"response": false, "reason": "Move not specified"}
     {"response": false, "reason": "Move not well-formed"}
     {"response": false, "reason": "Invalid x coordinate, 20"}
     {"response": false, "reason": "Invalid y coordinate, 30"}
